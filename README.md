# CalStats
 Retrieves data from your Google or Apple calendar and creates some statistics that might be useful to you (or your boss ;) )
 My stats are running live at https://mickekring.se/stats/time2/ (in Swedish)

## What is this? And what does it do?
I plan everything work related in my calendar and name the calendar events with prefixes like; '__ADM:__ Schedule' (ADM = Administration), '__WEB:__ Blogs' and so on. The script then groups all 'ADM:', 'WEB:' and other categories (hard coded in the script), calculates the time and divides it by the total time to get some percentages and other stuff that is useful to me. Simply put, it's a tool for me to make sure I spend my time well.<br />
I also have a second calendar where I put my 8 hours a day so that my script can compare how much I should have worked, and how much I've really worked.

The Python script runs on a Raspberry Pi and fetches and updates statistics every 10 minutes, uploads the php-files to my web server via sftp.

# Want to run it yourself?

This script is sort of tailored to my needs, so if you'd like to run it, you'll have to change a couple of things. Mainly names of the categories you'd like to track and in that case, some conditions. Since I'm not a coder, I haven't (yet) been able to set all things you have to change as constant variables or lists, but I'll do my best to guide you.

__WHAT YOU NEED__
* A device that can run Python 3.x
* A web server with php support
* An sftp server (on your web server) that the script uses to upload files to your web server
* A public Google calendar (or Apple calendar)

__SETUP__
* Download all files to a folder of your choice
* Open credentials.yml and change sftp account information, paths - both local url (where you run the script) and remote (on your web server) and the url to your public calendar .ics file
* Open index.php and edit the title and headings that you want to display on your front end
* Upload index.php and style.css to your web server
* Open main.py and change the following:
  * Line 36 | Locale
  * Line 41 | Start date from when the script should start track
  * Line 100-123 | Enter your own category prefixes and category names that you want to track
  * Line 129 | Exclude calendar events like lunch and unknown
  * Line 208 | The name of the calendar event in the second calendar (your work "official" work hours
  * Line 307 | Modify the categories you want to track
  * Line 623 | Modify the categories you want 7 week stats of and change/create lists names
  * Line 789 - 813 | Change to your categories
  * Line 827 - 840 | Change to your categories
  * Line 889 - 912 | Change to your categories
  * Line 632 - 640 | Change to your categories
  * Line 1027 | Modify how often you want the main loop to run in seconds
  * I may have missed a thing or two... sorry in advance...

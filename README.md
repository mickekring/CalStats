# CalStats
 Retrieves data from your Google or Apple calendar and creates some statistics
### What is it and what does it do?
It's a Python script that reads your calendar - and based on what you name your calendar events, it creates statistics from it. Then it updates a website so that you can view it in a more user friendly way.

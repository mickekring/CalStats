# CalStats
 Retrieves data from your Google or Apple calendar and creates some statistics
### What is it and what does it do?
It's a Python script that reads your calendar - and based on what you name your calendar events, it creates statistics from it. Then it updates a website so that you can view it in a more user friendly way.<br /><br >
I plan every day in my calendar and name the calendar events like; 'ADM: Schedule', 'WEB: Blogs' and so on. The script then groups all 'ADM:', 'WEB:' and other categories, calculates the time and divides it by the total time to get percentages.
### Disclaimer
